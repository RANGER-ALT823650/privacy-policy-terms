<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026</p>

<p>Thank you for using 图识 ("the App"). We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>图识 is designed with a privacy-first approach. The App primarily operates offline and does not collect personal data for tracking or advertising purposes.</p>

<h2>2. Information Collection</h2>

<p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information to developer-controlled servers.</strong></p>

<p>The App does not require account registration and does not build user profiles.</p>

<p>Data generated by the App (such as OCR results or imported dictionary files) is stored locally on your device unless you enable iCloud synchronization.</p>

<h2>3. Photo Library Permission</h2>

<p>The App may request access to your photo library for the following user-initiated features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selecting images for OCR word recognition</li>
<li>Choosing a profile avatar image</li>
<li>Adding images within user-created groups for collection and record purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>For all of the above scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Image processing occurs locally on your device.</li>
<li>No photos are uploaded to developer-controlled servers.</li>
<li>The App does not scan your photo library in the background.</li>
<li>Images remain stored only on your device and/or your personal iCloud (if enabled).</li>
<li>You can revoke photo access at any time in iOS Settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. iCloud Synchronization</h2>

<p>If you choose to enable iCloud, certain app data may be synchronized using Apple's iCloud services.</p>

<ul>
<li>Data is transmitted directly between your device and Apple.</li>
<li>The developer does not have access to your iCloud content.</li>
<li>iCloud data is governed by Apple's privacy policies and terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can disable iCloud at any time in your device settings.</p>

<h2>5. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>

<p>The App offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions (monthly and yearly) that unlock the full built-in dictionary (approximately 360,000 entries).</p>

<ul>
<li>Payments are processed by Apple via your App Store account.</li>
<li>The developer does not receive or store your payment information.</li>
<li>Subscription status is validated using Apple StoreKit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can continue to import and use their own MDX dictionaries without subscribing.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App does not include third-party analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, or cross-app tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<p>Because most data is stored locally on your device, you may delete app data at any time by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing imported files within the App</li>
<li>Deleting the App from your device</li>
<li>Disabling iCloud synchronization (if enabled)</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>

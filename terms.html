<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of 图识 ("the App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. License</h2>

<p>The App is licensed, not sold, to you for use on Apple-branded devices subject to the App Store Terms of Service.</p>

<p>The App offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monthly subscription: ¥4.9 per month</li>
<li>Yearly subscription: ¥49 per year</li>
</ul>

<p>Subscriptions unlock access to the full built-in dictionary (approximately 360,000 entries).</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Core functionality — including importing and using user-provided MDX dictionaries — remains available without subscription.</p>

<p>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</p>

<p>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>

<p>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.</p>

<p>You are responsible for any dictionary files or other content you import into the App and must ensure you have the legal right to use such materials.</p>

<h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>You agree not to misuse the App or attempt to interfere with its normal operation.</p>

<h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>The App and dictionary content are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of dictionary entries or OCR results.</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of the App.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
